# Real-time Computational Fluid Dynamics

This repository presents a real-time CFD solver based on a "rough" representation of conservation equations. The solver is implemented in C/C++ for real-time purpose and Qt for the user interface and graphical renderings. It supports a wide range of features:
- 2D problems (3D in progress)
- real-time flow patern variation
- variety of obstacles (in progress)
- drag-and-drop obstacles
- postprocessing using: scalars (pressure, velocity, tracer), streamlines and velocity vectors
